# Air_Monitor23
This repository contains working code for implementing an Arduino based Air Monitoring Sytem.

This project mainly aims to obtain a conclusive analysis on Air Quality Index (AQI) dependency on the factors like temperature, humidity and occupancy.

This project employs three sensors for gathering data.

These sensors are described below:

  1. RCWL-0516: Its is microwave sensor and is used for people detection.
  2. MQ2: This sensor is used to obtain pollutant levels in air.
  3. DHT11: Used for temperature and humidity measurement.
  4. ESP32: Used to send data to ThingSpeak cloud for analysis.
